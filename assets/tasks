# Fill this file with your tasks.
# Each tasks consists of three fields separated by commas: task tag, description and due date.
#
# Task tags are defined in your configuration file by the "tags" setting.
# Descriptions should not contain commas as they will be interpreted as field separators.
# Due dates should be in "year-month-day hour:minure" format.
# Any trailing whitespace symbols will be removed.
#
# Example:
#
# schoolwork, Genetics Problem Set, 2019-12-10 12:20
# schoolwork, Make presentation,    2019-12-20 12:00
# other,      work on rust program, 2020-02-29 13:00
# other,      wrap present for gf,  2019-02-11 14:00
# other,      memes,                2019-10-02 22:00
#
# Lines starting with "#" are considered comments and will be ignored.
# Malformed tasks (tasks with fields more or less than 3 fields) and overdue tasks will be ignored as well.
